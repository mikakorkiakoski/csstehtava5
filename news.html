            <h2>Making of Assignment two CSS</h2>
            <p>Assignment number two was pretty easy. I only changed navbar's buttons to different lines to be more
                mobile-friendly in portfolio-section.</p>
            <p>I figured out that mobile development is not that complex deal.</p>

            <h2>Making of this assignment</h2>
            <p>This assignment was really frustrating and i tried to do this many hours but i finally figured it out. I
                had to use a little bit of javascript.
                Best part of this function is that the code saves the theme you have set so you don't have to switch it
                individually at every endpoint. It also uses localStorage with every individual computer so it saves the theme only for your 
                computer like the cookies even if you exit the website. You can try this out by changing to dark theme with your computer and then going to website
                with your mobile device or with other computer. There should be light-theme then by default with other device. </p>

    <script>
        const lightThemeButton = document.getElementById("lightThemeButton");
        const darkThemeButton = document.getElementById("darkThemeButton");
        const body = document.body;

        // Check for the selected theme in local storage and apply it
        const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem("selectedTheme");
        if (savedTheme) {
            body.classList.add(savedTheme);
        }

        lightThemeButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
            body.classList.remove("dark-theme");
            localStorage.setItem("selectedTheme", "");
        });

        darkThemeButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
            body.classList.add("dark-theme");
            localStorage.setItem("selectedTheme", "dark-theme");
        });
    </script>
